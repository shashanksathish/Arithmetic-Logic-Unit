# Arithmetic-Logic-Unit
Technology Node is 65nm. With 0.4mW leakage power.

This Repo consists of design files with pitch and offset as a multiple of 0.26nm. The file consists of Design Files for D Flip Flop, AND, OR, NOR, NAND, MUX, XOR, INVERTER. Also it contains a filler cell with the same height as the other cells.

Additionally the file also consist of the ALU Layout in Design Vision. The Library Exchange Format is also provided that elaborates the minute details like Cell Area, Power Leakage etc.

To Use the file,
Place the files on the same directory and open Cadence Virtuoso. This is done for the 65nm process.
